## Creating a professional video for your online videos

Welcome to my first blog post at Adaptive Programming! If you have a Youtube channel or do any sort of video branding for your business, it's important to have a professional looking video animation intro to set you apart. Having a video logo for your business videos is the equivalent to a professonal looking website logo for your website.

Since I'm interested in educational video creation and course marketing, it seems logical to have a professional looking video intro.  Rather than hire a professonal or outsource the video creation as a one off, I decided to explore a do it yourself online service where you can create these videos yourself from professional templates.  I'm glad I did because I found Viddyoze and didn't need to look any further, it's simply awesome and perfect for my business.

## Here's the video animation intro I created with Viddyoze
