Hi there and welcome to AdaptiveProgrammer.com, a software development blog.

The goal of the blog is to learn and share practical information about modern agile transformation, adapting to change and thriving in life as a software developer. Well that's the intent at least.  The success of that goal will depend on the blog traffic and feedback from readers. 

The blog was inpsired by John Sonmez's blog, [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) so I give credit to John for inspiring me to create a blog and create more value as a professional developer.

I've worked in tech and software development projects for 25+ years, mostly in Software Engineering but also as a Electronics Engineer, Systems Engineer and Software Engineering Manager.  I've worked in a number of large commerical organisations, government organisations and small companies. I've worked with many people in the past, all from various and diverse backgrounds and progressions, System Analysts, Business Analysts, System Testers, Developers, Internal and External Clients, External Contractors, project stakeholders, company directors etc.

Through this blog I hope to share some insights and conclusions I've reached about work and life as a software developer which may be useful for other developers. I've seen a lot of changes in the software development industry over the last 30 years. When I started my career as an Electronics Engineer, I programmed Intel 8051 micro-controllers in assembly language. I was in the modern era of computing back then, no more punch cards! (I smile as a write this and think back to those early days and the size of the 10MB hard drives and the 256K of memory!) I feel privileged in a way to have gone through that era because it really makes me appreciate the modern computer power we have in our homes and on our mobiles.  I've always been passionate about technology and software development and remember getting hooked on software development after writing an application on an IBM XT using Turbo Pascal!

I chose the name of this blog to be AdaptiveProgrammer.com because "adaptive" has a dual meaning in this blog and conveys it's core theme:

* Writing `adaptive` code - The importance of writing code that is adaptable to changing business requirements cannot be understated. Writing extensible, maintainable code has become an essential ingredient of modern agile practices.

* Being an `adaptive` developer - Life as a software developer is tough and it's important to constantly expand your skillset or become obsolete. I believe that new developers entering the industry today need to manage their careers and adopt a more "entrepreneurial" mindset. Trading time for money as a software developer is no longer a long-term sustainable plan especially when you consider the extra hours that need to be invested into maintaining a skillsets and keeping yoru skills in demand for years and years to come. 

The #1 online training resource I recommened for professional developers is [Pluralsight](/out/pluralsight). Any serious developer should maintain a subscription and get into the habit of regularly updating their skills. If you scratch behind the surface of any "talented" software developer you know, I'll bet that person has invested time into becoming a better developer, either through technical books, online courses, reading blogs or through coding experimenation in their own time.
